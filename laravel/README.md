# Explanation web app

The code is a bit messy, so don't hesitate to contact us.

The web app consists of 4 pages: 'welcome.blade.php', 'waitView.blade.php', 'liveView.blade.php', and 'listTour.blade.php'. For styling and functionality, we have used CSS and JavaScript, which can be found in 'public/css/style.css' and 'public/js/app.js'.

There is some code that is not used, like 'mic_test.js'.

The reason why the 'mic_test.js' isn’t working is because there’s a loud sound when you start the code. We tried to fix the code, but nothing changed.

We would appreciate any feedback you have on the project. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.
